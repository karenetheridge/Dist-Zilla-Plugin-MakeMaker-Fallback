=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MakeMaker::Fallback - Generate a Makefile.PL containing a warning for legacy users

=head1 VERSION

version 0.031

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>, when you want to ship a F<Build.PL> as well as a fallback
F<Makefile.PL> in case the user's C<cpan> client is so old it doesn't recognize
C<configure_requires>:

    [ModuleBuildTiny]
    [MakeMaker::Fallback]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin is a derivative of C<[MakeMaker]>, generating a F<Makefile.PL> in
your distribution, with an added preamble that is printed when it is run:

=for Pod::Coverage after_build build test

=for stopwords cpanminus mb

=for comment This section was inserted from the DATA section at build time

    *** WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING ***

    If you're seeing this warning, your toolchain is really, really old* and
    you'll almost certainly have problems installing CPAN modules from this
    century. But never fear, dear user, for we have the technology to fix this!

    If you're using CPAN.pm to install things, then you can upgrade it using:

    cpan CPAN

    If you're using CPANPLUS to install things, then you can upgrade it using:

    cpanp CPANPLUS

    If you're using cpanminus, you shouldn't be seeing this message in the first
    place, so please file an issue on github.

    If you're using a packaging tool through a unix distribution, this issue
    should be reported to the package manager.

    If you're installing manually, please retrain your fingers to run Build.PL
    when present instead of Makefile.PL.

    This public service announcement was brought to you by the Perl Toolchain
    Gang, the irc.perl.org #toolchain IRC channel, and the number 42.

    ----

    * Alternatively, you are doing something overly clever, in which case you
    should consider setting the 'prefer_installer' config option in CPAN.pm, or
    'prefer_makefile' in CPANPLUS, to 'mb" and '0' respectively.

    You can also silence this warning for future installations by setting the
    PERL_MM_FALLBACK_SILENCE_WARNING environment variable.

=for stopwords ModuleBuildTiny

Additionally, any errors resulting from loading configure-require prerequisites are captured and printed, which
indicates a failure of the user or the tools to read and understand F<META.yml> or F<META.json>.

It is a fatal error to use this plugin when there is not also another
plugin enabled that generates a F<Build.PL> (such as
L<[ModuleBuildTiny]|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ModuleBuildTiny>).

On top of the regular testing that is provided via the F<Build.PL>-producing
plugin, C<dzil test --release> or C<dzil release> will run tests with extra
testing variables B<unset> (C<AUTHOR_TESTING>, C<RELEASE_TESTING>). This is to
weed out test issues that only manifest under these conditions (for example:
bad test count, conditional module loading).
You can prevent this extra testing from happening by setting C<skip_release_testing = 1>
in your configuration or F<dist.ini>.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

=for stopwords Peter Rabbitson ribasushi Matt Trout mst

Peter Rabbitson (ribasushi), whose concerns that low-level utility modules
were shipping with install tools that did not work out of the box with perls
5.6 and 5.8 inspired the creation of this module.

Matt Trout (mst), for realizing a simple warning would be sufficient, rather
than a complicated detection heuristic, as well as the text of the warning
(but it turns out that we still need a I<simple> detection heuristic, so -0.5
for that...)
